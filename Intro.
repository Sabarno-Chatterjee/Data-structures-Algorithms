Data Types:

1. System-defined data types (a lso called Primitive data types)

	Eg: int, noat, char, double, boo!, etc.

2. User-defined data types
	
	If the system-defined data types arc not enough, then most programming languages allow the users to define their own data types, called user - defined data types. Good examples of user defined data types are: structures in C/C + + and classes in Java.

Abstract Data Types (ADTs):

	Entities that are definitions of data and operations.

DATA STRUCTURES: Data structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficientlly. A data structure is a special format for organizing and storing data. General data structure types include arrays, files, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs and so on.

	Two types:
	1. Linear data structures: 

	Elements are accessed in a sequential order but it is not compubory to store all elements sequentially. 

	Examples: Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues.
	
	2. Non - linear data structures: 

	Elements of this data structure arc stored /accessed in a non-linear order.
	
	Examples: Trees and graphs.


# Running Time Analysis:

	Process of determining how processing time increases as the size of the problem (input size) increases.

# Rate of Growth:

	The rate at which Lhe running time inc reases as a function of input is ca lled rate of growth.
